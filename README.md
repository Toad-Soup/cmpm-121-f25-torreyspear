# CMPM 121 Section Activity

This section activity introduced me to many of the tools and workflows that I will use in CMPM 121, Game Development Patterns.

Key tools:

- [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces), a cloud-based development environment based [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) that runs in your web browser.
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), a CI/CD service that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline.
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), a static site hosting service that allows you to publish web content for free.

Key workflows:

- removed temporary text
- updated to increase counter
- updated the text on the screen to update the counter
